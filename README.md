# PurePlay-Anti-Cheat

**Free, Open-Source Anti-Cheat for Competitive Game Developers**

- *Note: This project is in development and is currently acting as my college Capstone project. It is not a working product.*

## Project Overview

**PurePlay Anti-Cheat** is an easy-to-implement, open-source anticheat solution designed to help game developers detect anomalous inputs across GamePad, Mouse, and Keyboard. By leveraging trained neural networks, the anti-cheat program can identify input sources using external devices or software cheats such as Xim, Cronus, or custom Arduino-based setups.

This solution is designed for **low-budget game developers** who need a reliable anti-cheat system that doesn’t require extensive networking integration or costly licensing. As it is only designed to catch external cheating sources, it is recommended to be used alongside an anti-cheat capable of catching memory-based cheats.

## Features

- **Supports Gamepad, Mouse, and Keyboard Inputs**
- **AI-Based Detection**: Trained neural networks identify anomalous input behavior.
- **Cross-Engine Compatibility**: Runs externally, independent of the game engine.
- **Customizable Tuning**: Developers can configure client/server models.
- **Lightweight Client & Server Models**: Supports server-only, client-only, or both depending on your setup.
- **Open Source & Free to Use**: No licensing fees, fully transparent, and community-driven.

## Model Tradeoffs

1. **Client-Only Model**:
   - Requires careful configuration to minimize performance impact.
   - Client-side processing only; may need manual review or automated filtering for results.

2. **Server-Only Model (NOT IMPLEMENTED)**:
   - Requires AI-capable hardware on servers, which may be costly but reduces client performance impacts.
   - Integration with the game engine required for networked view angles.

3. **Combined Model (NOT IMPLEMENTED)**:
   - Offers the highest accuracy.
   - Requires AI-capable hardware on both the server and client sides.
   - Involves deeper integration with the game engine.

## Getting Started

### Installation
